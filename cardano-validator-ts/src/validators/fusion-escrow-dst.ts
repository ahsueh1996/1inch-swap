/**
 * Fusion-compatible Cardano Escrow Destination Validator
 *
 * This validator mirrors the functionality of the EVM escrowDst.sol contract:
 *
 * EVM Contract Functions:
 * - withdraw(bytes32 secret, Immutables calldata immutables)
 * - publicWithdraw(bytes32 secret, Immutables calldata immutables)
 * - cancel(Immutables calldata immutables)
 *
 * Cardano Validator Redeemers:
 * - Withdraw: Private withdrawal by taker with secret verification
 * - PublicWithdraw: Public withdrawal by anyone (earns deposit) after timeout
 * - Cancel: Private cancellation by resolver after timeout
 * - PublicCancel: Public cancellation by anyone (earns deposit) after extended timeout
 *
 * Timeline (matches EVM contract):
 * ---- contract deployed ----/---- finality ----/---- PRIVATE WITHDRAWAL ----/---- PUBLIC WITHDRAWAL ----/
 * ----/---- private cancellation ----
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Secret-based HTLC for atomic swaps
 * - Time-locked phases for security
 * - Public operations with incentive deposits
 * - Multi-fill support via merkle trees
 * - Asset-agnostic (ADA and native tokens)
 * - Cross-chain compatibility with 1inch Fusion

/**
 * Parallel Functionality Mapping:

 * EVM escrowDst.sol                    ↔    Cardano fusion-escrow-dst.ts
 * =====================================    ================================
 *
 * contract EscrowDst                   ↔    fusionEscrowDst validator
 *
 * withdraw(secret, immutables)         ↔    Withdraw redeemer
 * - Only taker can call                ↔    - Check beneficiary signature
 * - Requires valid secret              ↔    - Validate secret hash
 * - Within withdrawal window           ↔    - Check user_deadline <= now < cancel_after
 * - Transfers funds to taker           ↔    - Send assets to beneficiary address
 * - Supports partial fills             ↔    - Update remaining amount in datum
 *
 * publicWithdraw(secret, immutables)   ↔    PublicWithdraw redeemer
 * - Anyone can call                    ↔    - No signature check required
 * - Requires valid secret              ↔    - Validate secret hash
 * - Within public window               ↔    - Check cancel_after <= now
 * - Caller earns deposit reward        ↔    - Send deposit to transaction submitter
 * - Transfers remaining to taker       ↔    - Send remaining assets to beneficiary
 *
 * cancel(immutables)                   ↔    Cancel redeemer
 * - Only resolver can call             ↔    - Check resolver signature
 * - After cancellation time            ↔    - Check now >= cancel_after
 * - Refunds resolver                   ↔    - Send all assets back to resolver
 *
 * N/A (dst doesn't have publicCancel) ↔    PublicCancel redeemer
 * - Anyone can call                    ↔    - No signature check required
 * - After extended timeout             ↔    - Check now >= cancel_after + extension
 * - Caller earns deposit reward        ↔    - Send deposit to transaction submitter
 * - Refunds resolver                   ↔    - Send remaining assets back to resolver
 *
 * Immutables struct                    ↔    FusionEscrowDatum
 * - maker: address                     ↔    - maker: PPubKeyHash
 * - taker: address                     ↔    - beneficiary: PPubKeyHash
 * - resolver: address                  ↔    - resolver: PPubKeyHash
 * - token: IERC20                      ↔    - asset_policy + asset_name: bs
 * - amount: uint256                    ↔    - remaining: int
 * - hashlock: bytes32                  ↔    - hashlock: bs
 * - timelocks: Timelocks               ↔    - user_deadline, cancel_after: int
 * - rescueDelay: uint32                ↔    - deposit_lovelace: int
 *
 * Key Differences from Source Escrow:
 * - Destination escrow is funded by resolver (not maker)
 * - Shorter timeline (no finality delay)
 * - Different participant roles (beneficiary vs taker)
 * - Supports merkle tree for partial fills
 * - Public operations earn deposit rewards
 *
 * Security Features (Both Chains):
 * - Atomic secret revelation
 * - Time-locked operation phases
 * - Public operation incentives
 * - Multi-fill merkle tree support
 * - Immutable parameters
 * - Emergency rescue mechanisms
