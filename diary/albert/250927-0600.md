# Direction Overview — 2025-09-27 06:07 AM

Our direction now seems to be:

1. **Limitation of existing solution**  
   a. Found that they don't use Fusion+

2. **Try Fusion+**  
   a. From [this doc](https://carnelian-raft-206.notion.site/Building-with-1inch-132af144f6708092be0ee25ec80cec4d#132af144f670809d8537dfe3d22e85f6) there is an example CLI script for submitting orders the Fusion+ way

3. **Identify the necessary pieces to extend to Cardano**

4. **Implement**

5. **Test**

Seems easy but it's not. There are a bunch of issues with extending this to Cardano that we are already anticipating.

## Challenges Extending Fusion+ to Cardano

1. **Fusion+ is EVM-only**  
   - Fusion+ resolvers, Dutch auctions, and APIs are designed for EVM chains.  
   - Cardano is UTxO-based with different script semantics. You can’t just “drop in” Fusion+ code; you’d have to bridge Fusion+’s escrow semantics into a Cardano validator.  
   - This means writing a Cardano Plutus validator that mirrors the same intent/secret/timelock conditions and making sure the Fusion+ API/network knows how to reference that escrow.

2. **Secret / hashlock alignment**  
   - In your repo, the EVM escrow checks `sha256(secret) == hashlock`. Cardano must do the same.  
   - Fusion+ uses resolvers to reveal secrets as part of fulfilling intents. Unless the Cardano side is perfectly aligned on hash function, encoding, and timelock offsets, one side might expire before the other, breaking atomicity.

3. **Timelock coordination**  
   - Fusion+ assumes relatively consistent block times across EVM chains. Cardano slots are different (~20s).  
   - To stay safe, you’d need to cascade timelocks (Cardano’s deadline < EVM’s deadline by a margin). If not parameterized correctly, the auction duration + Cardano settlement latency could cause one side to expire.

4. **Partial fills & accounting**  
   - Fusion+ supports partial fills (resolvers can split an order).  
   - Cardano HTLCs today are “all-or-nothing.” If you want partials, you’d need to redesign your Cardano datum and validator to track proportional fills (multiple secrets/claims). Otherwise, Fusion+’s biggest liquidity benefit is lost.

5. **Dependency on 1inch resolver network**  
   - Today your repo has its own watcher/relayer. With Fusion+, you’d depend on 1inch resolvers to notice your order and compete to fill it.  
   - If 1inch resolvers don’t support Cardano in their routes, your intents would never sett
