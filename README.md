Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and one of the following non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos. (Solana is excluded because we have already built it)

Qualification Requirements
Requirements: 
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation. 
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum) 
- Onchain execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo
- Proper Git commit history (no single-commit entries on the final day)
