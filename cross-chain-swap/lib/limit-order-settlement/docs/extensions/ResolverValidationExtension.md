## ResolverValidationExtension

This abstract contract combines functionalities to enhance security and compliance in the order execution process.
Ensures that only transactions from whitelisted resolvers or resolvers who own specific accessToken are processed within the post-interaction phase of order execution.
Additionally, it allows charging a fee to resolvers in the `postInteraction` method, providing a mechanism for resolver fee management.

### Functions
### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IERC20 feeToken, contract IERC20 accessToken, address owner) internal
```

### _isWhitelisted

```solidity
function _isWhitelisted(uint256 allowedTime, bytes whitelist, uint256 whitelistSize, address resolver) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Validates whether the resolver is whitelisted._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| allowedTime | uint256 | The time after which interaction with the order is allowed. |
| whitelist | bytes | Whitelist is tightly packed struct of the following format: ``` (bytes10,bytes2)[N] resolversAddressesAndTimeDeltas; ``` Resolvers in the list are sorted in ascending order by the time when they are allowed to interact with the order. Time deltas represent the time in seconds between the adjacent resolvers. Only 10 lowest bytes of the resolver address are used for comparison. |
| whitelistSize | uint256 | The amount of resolvers in the whitelist. |
| resolver | address | The resolver to check. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
[0] | bool | Whether the resolver is whitelisted. |

### _getResolverFee

```solidity
function _getResolverFee(uint256 fee, uint256 orderMakingAmount, uint256 actualMakingAmount) internal pure virtual returns (uint256)
```

_Calculates the resolver fee._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| fee | uint256 | Scaled resolver fee. |
| orderMakingAmount | uint256 | Making amount from the order. |
| actualMakingAmount | uint256 | Making amount that was actually filled. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
[0] | uint256 | resolverFee Calculated resolver fee. |

### _postInteraction

```solidity
function _postInteraction(struct IOrderMixin.Order order, bytes extension, bytes32 orderHash, address taker, uint256 makingAmount, uint256 takingAmount, uint256 remainingMakingAmount, bytes extraData) internal virtual
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| order | struct IOrderMixin.Order |  |
| extension | bytes |  |
| orderHash | bytes32 |  |
| taker | address |  |
| makingAmount | uint256 |  |
| takingAmount | uint256 |  |
| remainingMakingAmount | uint256 |  |
| extraData | bytes | Structured data of length n bytes, segmented as follows: [0:4] - Resolver fee information. [4:8] - The time after which interaction with the order is allowed. [8:k] - Data as defined by the `whitelist` parameter for the `_isWhitelisted` method,         where k depends on the amount of resolvers in the whitelist, as indicated by the bitmap in the last byte. [k:n] - ExtraData for other extensions, not utilized by this validation extension. [n] - Bitmap indicating various usage flags and values.       The bitmask xxxx xxx1 signifies resolver fee usage.       The bitmask VVVV Vxxx represents the number of resolvers in the whitelist, where the V bits denote the count of resolvers.       The remaining bits in this bitmap are not used by this extension. |

### Errors
### ResolverCanNotFillOrder

```solidity
error ResolverCanNotFillOrder()
```
